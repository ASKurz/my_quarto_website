I am a full-time research psychologist, with a doctorate in clinical psychology from the [University of Mississippi](https://psychology.olemiss.edu/) in 2018. My main gig is as a researcher and statistics/methods consultant at the VISN 17 Center of Excellence. 

It's been a minute, but I am also trained as a therapist. My primary therapeutic orientations are ACT and mindfulness-based interventions. I have had additional focused training in the areas of trauma and substance use.

I also spend a lot of time making tutorial material on applied statistics, particularly from with the R computing framework.
