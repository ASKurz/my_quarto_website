## Introduction

In this second blog post, I'll make a figure in R.

### Data

Load the tidyverse package for data wrangling, and the psych package for the data.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(psych)
```

We'll use the `bfi` data set from the psych package. We can look at those data with the `glimpse()` function.

```{r}
glimpse(bfi)
```

### Sum scores

Here we'll add the sum scores for the Extroversion and Neuroticism scales to the data file.

```{r}
bfi <- bfi %>% 
  mutate(e = E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 + E5,
         n = N1 + N2 + N3 + N4 + N5)
```         

### Figure

We can make a scatter plot of the Extroversion and Neuroticism sum scores.

```{r}
bfi %>% 
  drop_na(n, e) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = e, color = gender)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.25, height = 0.25, size = 0.5) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "C", begin = 0.2, end = 0.6, breaks = NULL) +
  labs(x = "Neuroticism", y = "Extroversion") +
  facet_wrap(~ gender, labeller = label_both)
```

## Correlations

Were you curious about the correlations? Here they are by `gender`.

```{r}
bfi %>% 
  drop_na(n, e) %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(r = cor(e, n))
```

Here is the overall correlation.

```{r}
bfi %>% 
  drop_na(n, e) %>% 
  summarise(r = cor(e, n))
```

## Session information

To make the results reproducible, here is my sesssion information.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

# Here is where I make the picture for the `image`
ggplot() +
  annotate(geom = "point",
           x = 0, y = 0, 
           color = "lightblue1", size = 50) +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           x = 0, y = 0, label = 2, 
           color = "blue3", size = 30) +
  theme_void()

ggsave("featured-2.png", width = 3, height = 3)
```
