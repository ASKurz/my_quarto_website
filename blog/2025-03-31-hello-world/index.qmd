This is my first blog post! ðŸŽ‰

It has a section header:

## This is a section header

It has equations:

$$y = mx + b$$

It has a [hyperlink](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

It has an embedded YouTube video.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

vembedr::use_align(
  vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/l7r24gTEkEY?si=K2uL7XOTeZ_ObmCV"),

And it even has an image imported from a `.jpg` file.
